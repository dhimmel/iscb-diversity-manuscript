## Results

We curated a dataset of ISCB honorees that included 412 honorees who were keynote speakers at international ISCB-associated conferences (ISMB and RECOMB) as well as ISCB Fellows.
The ISCB Fellows set contained the complete set of Fellows named (2009--2019).
Keynote speakers were available for ISMB for all years from 1993--2019.
Keynote speakers for RECOMB were available for all years from 1997--2019.
We included individuals who were honored multiple times as separate entries.
For example, Christine Orengo was a keynote speaker at RECOMB 2004 and became an ISCB Fellow in 2016, and thus was counted twice in this list.

We sought to compare this dataset with a background distribution of potential speakers, which we considered to be last authors of bioinformatics and computational biology manuscripts.
We scraped PubMed for manuscripts written in English from 1993--2019 with the MeSH term ["computational biology"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22Computational+Biology%22%5BMeSH+Terms%5D+).
We downloaded the metadata of manuscripts published in these journals from PubMed, which provided 176,110 articles for evaluation.
For each article, we extracted its last author's fore name and last name for analysis.

In a [previous version](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity-manuscript/v/711edb01f5335a4c1bb8e1e0575618586a7abf9b/) of this work, instead of last authors, we examined corresponding authors of articles in three well-recognized computational biology journals, and the results were consistent with our findings here [@url:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.927251v1.full].

### Technical considerations

Selecting an optimal study design is the important first step to acquire an accurate and thorough answer to any research question.
This study is not an exception: we were faced with multiple decisions at many analysis steps.
We are grateful to all the reviewers whose input made the study more rigorous after each revision.
As we discussed and revised the analysis, we committed to stay transparent and documented the reasoning and potential caveats of each decision.
Details of these discussions can be found under the [Issues page](https://github.com/greenelab/iscb-diversity-manuscript/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) on the study GitHub repository.
We highlighted here four important decisions we made and how each one may affect the result (Fig. {#fig:versions}).

Study progression.
In [version 1](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity-manuscript/v/711edb01f5335a4c1bb8e1e0575618586a7abf9b/) of this work, instead of last authors, we examined corresponding authors of articles in three well-recognized computational biology journals, 
and the results were consistent with our findings in [version 2](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity-manuscript/v/6bda862974e77beb98697f39c18027683af158cb/), where we expanded the article dataset to include all PubMed articles with the MeSH terms "computational biology". 
Finally, in this [latest version](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity-manuscript/), we used citation count to weight articles to account for the impact variation of research contributions.
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenelab/iscb-diversity/1e45ddccdd1a5b180fc8b0a132a7c9e4646782a5/figs/versions.png){#fig:versions}

Our findings across different versions of the study were generally consistent.
We first expanded the article set from 29,755 journal-specific to 176,110 all computational biology PubMed articles, making the sample size nearly six times larger than previously.
We also extracted names of last authors instead of corresponding authors to better capture the honoree population.
Our assumption was that, in the list of authors for a specific paper, last authors (often research advisors) would be most likely to be invited for keynotes or to be honored as fellows.
Also, the availability of information on corresponding authors was limited, and extracting last author became a more consistent approach.
However, we acknowledged that we might have miss corresponding authors in the first position who can be considered for keynote speakers or fellows [@doi:10.1177/0306312716650046].

In version 3, instead of considering all articles equally as in the earlier versions, we used citation count to weight articles to control for the differential impact of research contributions.
However, we note a potential bias for using citation counts: female scientists of different disciplines are cited less often than their male counterparts [@arxiv:2001.01002; @doi:10.1002/ece3.4993; @doi:10.1038/s41550-017-0141].
To the extent that there may be a bias in citation practices, we should expect that the bias for honorees would align with one for citations, meaning that our analysis would understate the severity of disparities.
Previously in version 1--2, without citation counts, we found even more pronounced differences between the two groups of authors and honorees.

Finally, in all versions of the analysis, rather than applying a hard assignment for each prediction, we analyzed the raw prediction probability values to capture the uncertainty of the prediction model, improving the accuracy of the aggregate statistics.
Although our final estimates of the effect size may be conservative (see more in Discussion), the general conclusion remained robust throughout different sets of study design parameters.
If other researchers aim to answer similar questions of their field, our recommendation is to take caution when making these decisions and account for field-specific factors such as authorship practice.

### Similar gender proportion between ISCB's honorees and the field

We observed a gradual increase of the proportion of predicted female authors, arriving at an average of approximately 27% in 2017-2019 (Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}, left).
In recent years, ISCB Fellows and keynote speakers appear to have similar gender proportion compared to the population of authors published in computational biology and bioinformatics journals (averaged around 30% in the last three years, Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}, right).
Examining each honor category, we observed an increasing trend of honorees who were women, especially in the group of ISCB Fellows (see [notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/10.visualize-gender.html#sup_fig_s1)), which markedly increased after 2015.
Through 2019, there were a number of years when meetings or ISCB Fellow classes have a high probability of recognizing only male honorees and none that appeared to have exclusively female honorees.
We sought to examine whether or not there was a difference in the proportion of female names between authors and honorees. 
A multiple linear regression of this proportion for the groups and year did not reveal a significant difference (_p_ = 0.237).

### Honorees with Celtic/English names are overrepresented while honorees with East Asian names are underrepresented

We applied our Wiki2019-LSTM model to both our computational biology honorees dataset and our dataset of last authors.
We found that the proportion of authors with Celtic/English names had decreased (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}A, left).
Among keynote speakers and fellows, we found that the majority of honorees are predicted to have Celtic/English or European names (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}A, right).
When we directly compared honoree composition with PubMed, we observed discrepancies between the two groups (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}B).
A name coming from the group of honorees has significantly higher probability of being Celtic/English ($\beta$~Celtic/English~ = 0.10, _p_ = 1.2×10^-4^) and lower probability of being East Asian ($\beta$~East\ Asian~ = -0.12, _p_ = 5.8×10^-7^).
The two groups of scientists did not have a significant association with names predicted to be European and in Other categories (_p_ = 0.74 and _p_ = 0.63, respectively).

  Compared to the name collection of Pubmed authors, honorees with Celtic/English names are overrepresented while honorees with East Asian names are underrepresented.
  No statistically significant difference was observed between the proportion of honorees and authors with European names or in other categories (see Table @tbl:example_names).

When applying the Wiki2019-LSTM model to the name origins of only US-affiliated scientists, we found a similar but less severe underrepresentation of honorees with East Asian names ($\beta$~East\ Asian~ = -0.09, _p_ = 0.0012).
We observed no statistically significant difference between the proportion of honorees and authors with Celtic/English names, European names, or names in Other categories (_p_ = 0.26, _p_ = 0.13, and _p_ = 0.88, respectively).
We note that the US was not included in the training of the Wiki2019-LSTM model (see Methods).

### Overrepresentation of US-affiliated honorees

We analyzed the countries of affiliation between last authors and ISCB honorees.
For each country, we report a value of log~2~ enrichment (LOE) and its 95% confidence intervals.
The full table with all countries and their corresponding enrichment can be browsed interactively in the corresponding [analysis notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/12.analyze-affiliation.html#enrichment_tab).
A positive value of LOE indicates a higher proportion of honorees affiliated with that country compared to authors.
A LOE value of 1 represents a one-fold enrichment (i.e., observed number of honorees is twice as much as expected).
In the 20 countries with the most publications, we found an overrepresentation of honorees affiliated with institutions and companies in the US (119 speakers more than expected, LOE = 1.0, 95% CI (0.8, 1.2)) and Israel (15 speakers more than expected, LOE = 2.7, 95% CI (1.9, 3.4)), and an underrepresentation of honorees affiliated with those in China, France, Italy, India, South Korea, and Brazil (Fig. @fig:country-enrichment).

Countries are ordered based on the proportion of authors in the field.
The overrepresentation of honorees affiliated with institutions and companies in the US and Israel contrasts the underrepresentation of honorees affiliated with those in China, France, Italy, India, South Korea, and Brazil.

### Improvements to Honoree Diversity Subsequent to Our Primary Analysis

While our study was primarily designed to assess the diversity of honorees, the findings raise important questions about what can be done to address the disparities.
By publishing our original findings on the biorxiv preprint server, we could begin to answer these questions by examining changes subsequent to our initial report.
We released [version 1.0](https://github.com/greenelab/iscb-diversity-manuscript/releases/tag/v1.0) of our manuscript on 2020-01-30.
Early indications suggest ISCB is now increasing the diversity of honorees.
In 2020, among 12 ISCB Fellows and 5 ISMB keynote speakers, the mean predicted probability of each honoree having an East Asian name is 33%, higher than any estimate in previous years (see [notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/15.analyze-2020.html)).
The set of honorees also includes the first ISCB Fellow from China.
Compared to past years, the 2020 honorees appear to better reflect the diversity of scientists in the computational biology field.
These new results suggest: 1) deserving honorees who were members of under-recognized groups existed but had not been recognized until now, and 2) simply examining honoree distribution's alignment with the field can trigger changes that address issues of unequal representation.
However, we note that this analysis dealt only with more senior scientists (the last authors on scientific manuscripts) in the context of honors and that many years of changed honoree distributions will be required for the set of honored scientists to better reflect the field's senior author contributions.
