## Results

We curated a dataset of ISCB honorees that included 412 honorees who were keynote speakers at international ISCB-associated conferences (ISMB and RECOMB) as well as ISCB Fellows.
The ISCB Fellows set contained the complete set of Fellows named (2009--2019).
Keynote speakers were available for ISMB for all years from 1993--2019.
Keynote speakers for RECOMB were available for all years from 1997--2019.
We included individuals who were honored multiple times as separate entries.
For example, Christine Orengo was a keynote speaker at RECOMB 2004 and became an ISCB Fellow in 2016, and thus was counted twice in this list.

We sought to compare this dataset with a background distribution of potential speakers, which we considered to be last authors of bioinformatics and computational biology manuscripts.
We scraped PubMed for manuscripts written in English from 1993--2019 with the MeSH term ["computational biology"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22Computational+Biology%22%5BMeSH+Terms%5D+).
We downloaded the metadata of manuscripts published in these journals from PubMed, which provided 173,735 articles for evaluation.
For each article, we extracted its last author's fore name and last name for analysis.

In a [previous version](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity-manuscript/v/711edb01f5335a4c1bb8e1e0575618586a7abf9b/) of this work, instead of last authors, we examined corresponding authors of articles in three well-recognized computational biology journals, and the results were consistent with our findings here [@url:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.927251v1.full].

### Similar gender proportion between ISCB's honorees and the field

We observed a gradual increase of the proportion of predicted female authors, arriving at 28.8% in 2019 (Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}, left).
In recent years, ISCB Fellows and keynote speakers appear to have similar gender proportion compared to the population of authors published in computational biology and bioinformatics journals (Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}, right); however, it has not yet reached parity.
Examining each honor category, we observed an increasing trend of honorees who were women, especially in the group of ISCB Fellows (see [notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/10.visualize-gender.html#sup_fig_s1)), which markedly increased after 2015.
Through 2019, there were a number of years when meetings or ISCB Fellow classes have a high probability of recognizing only male honorees and none that appeared to have exclusively female honorees.
We sought to examine whether or not there was a difference in the proportion of female names between authors and honorees. 
A multiple linear regression of this proportion for the groups and year did not reveal a significant difference (_p_ = 0.558).

### Honorees with Celtic/English names are overrepresented while honorees with East Asian names are underrepresented

We applied our Wiki2019-LSTM model to both our computational biology honorees dataset and our dataset of last authors.
We found that the proportion of authors with Celtic/English names had decreased (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}A, left).
Among keynote speakers and fellows, we found that the majority of honorees are predicted to have Celtic/English or European names (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}A, right).
When we directly compared honoree composition with PubMed, we observed discrepancies between the two groups (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}B).
A name coming from the group of honorees has significantly higher probability of being Celtic/English ($\beta_textrm{Celtic/English}= 0.11924$, _p_ < 10^-9^)) and lower probability of being East Asian ($\beta_textrm{East Asian}= -0.14791$, _p_ < 10^-9^)). 
The two groups of scientists did not have a significant association with names predicted to be European and in Other categories (_p_ = 0.39475 and _p_ = 0.48625, respectively).

  Compared to the name collection of Pubmed authors, honorees with Celtic/English names are overrepresented while honorees with East Asian names are underrepresented.
  No statistically significant difference was observed between the proportion of honorees and authors with European names or in other categories (see Table @tbl:example_names).

We reached similar conclusion when applying the Wiki2019-LSTM model to the name origins of only US-affiliated scientists.
We note that the US was not included in the training of the Wiki2019-LSTM model (see Methods).
We found an overrepresentation of honorees with Celtic/English names ($\beta_textrm{Celtic/English}= 0.053$, _p_ = 0.031), a smaller overrepresentation of honorees with European names ($\beta_textrm{European}= 0.046$, _p_ = 0.042) and substantial underrepresentation of honorees with East Asian names ($\beta_textrm{East Asian}= -0.010$, _p_ = 3.6\*10^-5^).
No statistically significant difference was observed between the proportion of honorees and authors with names in Other categories (see Table @tbl:example_names, _p_ = 0.95).

### Overrepresentation of US-affiliated honorees

We analyzed the countries of affiliation between last authors and ISCB honorees.
For each country, we report a value of log~2~ enrichment (LOE) and its 95% confidence intervals.
The full table with all countries and their corresponding enrichment can be browsed interactively in the corresponding [analysis notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/12.analyze-affiliation.html#enrichment_tab).
A positive value of LOE indicates a higher proportion of honorees affiliated with that country compared to authors.
A LOE value of 1 represents a one-fold enrichment (i.e., observed number of honorees is twice as much as expected).
In the 20 countries with the most publications, we found an overrepresentation of honorees affiliated with institutions and companies in the US (153 speakers more than expected, LOE = 1.1, 95% CI (0.9, 1.2)) and Israel (14 speakers more than expected, LOR = 2.5, 95% CI (1.7, 3.1)), and an underrepresentation of honorees affiliated with those in China, France, Italy, India, the Netherlands, Korea, Brazil and Taiwan  (Fig. @fig:country-enrichment).

and the absolute difference between observed (triangle) and expected (circle) number of honorees (right).
Positive value of LOE indicates a higher proportion of honorees affiliated with that country compared to authors.
Countries are ordered based on the proportion of authors in the field.
The overrepresentation of honorees affiliated with institutions and companies in the US and Israel contrasts the underrepresentation of honorees affiliated with those in China, France, Italy, India, the Netherlands, Korea, Brazil and Taiwan.

### Overrepresentation of white and underrepresentation of Asian honorees among US-affiliated scientists

We predicted the race and ethnicity of US-affiliated authors and honorees using wru, which is based on US census data.
We found that an increasing proportion of last authors of computational biology papers whose last names associated with selecting Asian as a race/ethnicity category in the US census (Fig. {@fig:us_racial_makeup}A left).
Compared to Pubmed authors, ISCB honorees with US affiliations have a higher proportion of individuals whose last names were associated with selecting white as a race/ethnicity category in the US census (Fig. {@fig:us_racial_makeup}A).
Specifically, a name coming from the group of honorees has significantly higher probability of being white ($\beta_\textrm{white}= 0.0975$, _p_ = 1.4\*10^-5^) and lower probability of being Asian, ($\beta_\textrm{Asian}= - 0.1122$, _p_ = 1.7\*10^-6^). 
The two groups of scientists did not have a significant association with names predicted to be in Other categories (_p_ = 0.16662).
Separating honoree results by honor category did not reveal any clear differences among the categories (see [notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/13.us-race-analysis.html#hypothesis-testing).

  (B) For each race/ethnicity category, the mean predicted probability of Pubmed articles is shown as teal generalized additive model (GAM) curve, and the mean probability and 95% confidence interval of the ISCB honoree predictions are shown as dark circles and vertical lines.
  The large difference between the means and the lack of overlaping of the confidence intervals in most years indicates an overrepresentation of white and underrepresentation of Asian honorees as compared to authors.

### Reception & Feedback

We released [version 1.0](https://github.com/greenelab/iscb-diversity-manuscript/releases/tag/v1.0) of our manuscript on 2020-01-30.
The study received public feedback almost immediately.
Specifically, a community member [pointed out](https://github.com/greenelab/iscb-diversity-manuscript/issues/27) problems with the country-group names we imported from NamePrism.
We also appreciate other anonymous reviewers for their valuable feedback on the early versions of the study.
Much of the concerns centered around the inherent imperfections of automated detection of race or nationality.
Therefore, we expanded our assessment to include country of affiliation, which can be detected with high fidelity from PubMed metadata.
Adding affiliation information allowed us to examine disparities within a single country and to rule out geographic disparities as the sole factor leading to an underrepresentation of Asian honorees.

Early indications suggest ISCB may be heeding the findings of our analysis and increasing the diversity of honorees.
In 2020, among 12 ISCB Fellows and 5 ISMB keynote speakers, the mean predicted probability of each honoree having an East Asian name is 33%, higher than any estimate in previous years (see [notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/15.analyze-2020.html)).
The set of honorees also includes the first ISCB Fellow from China.
Compared to past years, the 2020 honorees appear to better reflect the diversity of scientists in the computational biology field.
