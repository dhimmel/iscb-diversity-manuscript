## Results

We curated a dataset of ISCB honorees that included 412 honorees who were keynote speakers at international ISCB-associated conferences (ISMB and RECOMB) as well as ISCB Fellows.
The ISCB Fellows set contained the complete set of Fellows named (2009--2019).
Keynote speakers were available for ISMB for all years from 1993--2019.
Keynote speakers for RECOMB were available for all years from 1997--2019.
We included individuals who were honored multiple times as separate entries.
For example, Christine Orengo was a keynote speaker at RECOMB 2004 and became an ISCB Fellow in 2016, and thus was counted twice in this list.

We sought to compare this dataset with a background distribution of potential speakers, which we considered to be last or senior authors of bioinformatics and computational biology manuscripts.
We used those published in [Bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics), [BMC Bioinformatics](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/), and [PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/) as a set of bioinformatics and computational biology manuscripts.
We downloaded the metadata of manuscripts published in these journals from PubMed, which provided almost 30,000 articles for evaluation.
However, although PubMed provides author order, it does not provide corresponding author information.
To determine corresponding authors for an article, we used the PMC corresponding author information when it was available (20,696 articles) and the PubMed last author as a fallback when corresponding author information was missing (9,053 articles).

### Similar gender proportion between ISCB's honorees and the field

Although _Bioinformatics_ was established in 1998 and _BMC Bioinformatics_ in 2000, the metadata for these journal papers before 2002 only have initials for first and/or middle author names.
Therefore, without first and middle names, we do not have author gender predictions before this year.

We observed a slow increase of the proportion of predicted female authors, arriving at just over 20% in 2019 (Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}, left).
We observe very similar trend within each journal, but estimated female proportion has increased the most in _BMC Bioinformatics_ (see [notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/10.visualize-gender.html#sup_fig_s1)).
In recent years, ISCB Fellows and keynote speakers appear to have similar gender proportion compared to the population of authors published in computational biology and bioinformatics journals (Fig. {@fig:gender_breakdown}, right); however, it has not yet reached parity.
Further, taking all the years together, a Welch two-sample t-test did not reveal any statistically significant difference in the mean probability of ISCB honorees predicted to be female compared to that of authors (t~419~ = 0.840, _p_ = 0.402).
We observed an increasing trend of honorees who were women in each honor category, especially in the group of ISCB Fellows (see [notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/10.visualize-gender.html#sup_fig_s1)), which markedly increased after 2015.
Through 2019, there were a number of years when meetings or ISCB Fellow classes have a high probability of recognizing only male honorees and none that appeared to have exclusively female honorees.

### Honorees with Celtic/English names are overrepresented while honorees with East Asian names are underrepresented

We applied our Wiki2019-LSTM model to both our computational biology honorees dataset and our dataset of corresponding authors.
We found that the proportion of authors with Celtic/English names had decreased (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}A, left), particularly for papers published in _Bioinformatics_ and _BMC Bioinformatics_ (see [notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/11.visualize-name-origins.html#sup_fig_s4)).
Among keynote speakers and fellows, we found that the majority of honorees are predicted to have Celtic/English or European names (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}A, right).
When we directly compared honoree composition with PubMed, we observed discrepancies between the two groups, namely a large overrepresentation of keynote speakers with Celtic/English names (t~418~ = 9.01, _p_ < 10^-16^) and a substantial underrepresentation of keynote speakers with East Asian names (t~454~ = -15.8, _p_ < 10^-16^) (Fig. {@fig:region_breakdown}B).
No statistically significant difference was observed between the proportion of honorees and authors with European names (t~425~ = 0.0282, _p_ = 0.489) or in other categories (see Table @tbl:example_names, t~425~ = -0.176, _p_ = 0.860).

  Compared to the name collection of Pubmed authors, honorees with Celtic/English names are overrepresented while honorees with East Asian names are underrepresented.
  No statistically significant difference was observed between the proportion of honorees and authors with European names or in other categories (see Table @tbl:example_names).

### Overrepresentation of US-affiliated honorees

We analyzed the countries of affiliation between corresponding authors and ISCB honorees.
For each country, we report a value of log~2~ enrichment (LOE) and its 95% confidence intervals.
The full table with all countries and their corresponding enrichment can be browsed interactively in the corresponding [analysis notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/12.analyze-affiliation.html#enrichment_tab).
A positive value of LOE indicates a higher proportion of honorees affiliated with that country compared to authors.
A LOE value of 1 represents a one-fold enrichment (i.e., observed number of honorees is twice as much as expected).
In the 20 countries with the most publications, we found an overrepresentation of honorees affiliated with institutions and companies in the US (97 speakers more than expected, LOE = 0.6, 95% CI (0.5, 0.8)) and Israel (12 speakers more than expected, LOR = 1.6, 95% CI (0.9, 2.3)), and an underrepresentation of honorees affiliated with those in China, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and India (Fig. @fig:country-enrichment).

and the absolute difference between observed (triangle) and expected (circle) number of honorees (right).

Countries are ordered based on the proportion of authors in the field.
The overrepresentation of honorees affiliated with institutions and companies in the US and Israel contrasts the underrepresentation of honorees affiliated with those in China, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and India.

### Overrepresentation of white and underrepresentation of Asian honorees among US-affiliated scientists

We predicted the race and ethnicity of US-affiliated authors and honorees using wru, which is based on US census data.
We found that an increasing proportion of authors in computational biology and bioinformatics journals had last names associated with selecting Asian as a race/ethnicity category in the US census (Fig. {@fig:us_racial_makeup}A).
This was primarily driven by publications in _Bioinformatics_ and _BMC Bioinformatics_ (Fig. {@fig:us_racial_makeup}C, top).
We did not observe a corresponding increase at _PLOS Computational Biology_ (Fig. {@fig:us_racial_makeup}C, bottom).
Compared to Pubmed authors, ISCB honorees with US affiliations have a higher proportion of individuals whose last names we associated with selecting white as a race/ethnicity category in the US census (Fig. {@fig:us_racial_makeup}B vs. A).
Separating honoree results by honor category did not reveal any clear differences (Fig. {@fig:us_racial_makeup}D).

  (E) For each race/ethnicity category, the mean predicted probability of Pubmed articles is shown as teal LOESS curve, and the mean probability and 95% confidence interval of the ISCB honoree predictions are shown as dark circles and vertical lines.
  The large difference between the means and the lack of overlaping of the confidence intervals in most years indicates an overrepresentation of white and underrepresentation of Asian honorees as compared to authors.

We directly compared honoree and author results from 1993 to 2019 for the predicted proportion of white, Asian, and other categories (see [notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/13.us-race-analysis.html#what-about-p-values) and Fig. {@fig:us_racial_makeup}E).
We found that, over the years, white honorees have been significantly overrepresented (t~218~ = 14.8, _p_ < 10^-16^) and Asian honorees have been significantly underrepresented (t~236~ = -18.8, _p_ < 10^-16^).
A Welch two-sample t-test did not reveal any statistically significant difference in the mean probability of ISCB speakers predicted to be in Other categories compared to authors (t~203~ = 1.79, _p_ = 0.0747).

### Substantial underrepresentation of honorees with East Asian names among US-affiliated scientists

We applied our Wiki2019-LSTM model to US-affiliated authors and honorees and found similar pattern as when we considered all authors and honorees.
We note that the US was not included in the training of the Wiki2019-LSTM model (see Methods).
Specifically, the proportion of authors with Celtic/English names had decreased (Fig. {@fig:us_name_origin}A, left), particularly for papers published in _Bioinformatics_ and _BMC Bioinformatics_ (see [notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/14.us-name-origin.html#sup_fig_s6)).
Meanwhile, the majority of honorees are predicted to have Celtic/English or European names (Fig. {@fig:us_name_origin}A, right).
When we directly compared honoree composition with PubMed, we observed discrepancies between the two groups, namely a large overrepresentation of honorees with Celtic/English names (t~247~ = 6.46, _p_ < 10^-9^), a smaller overrepresentation of honorees with European names (t~250~ = 2.54, _p_ = 0.0059), and a substantial underrepresentation of honorees with East Asian names (t~329~ = -20.6, _p_ < 10^-16^) (Fig. {@fig:us_name_origin}B).
No statistically significant difference was observed between the proportion of honorees and authors with names in other categories (see Table @tbl:example_names, t~252~ = -0.152, _p_ = 0.879).

### Reception & Feedback

We released [version 1.0](https://github.com/greenelab/iscb-diversity-manuscript/releases/tag/v1.0) of our manuscript on 2020-01-30.
We submitted this version to the 28^th^ annual ISMB conference planned for July 2020 in Montreal.
The study received public feedback almost immediately.
Specifically, a community member [pointed out](https://github.com/greenelab/iscb-diversity-manuscript/issues/27) problems with the country-group names we imported from NamePrism.

On 2020-02-20, ISCB released a [statement on equity and inclusion](https://www.iscb.org/iscb-news-items/4257-2020-feb20-iscb-announcement) that alluded to our study, but did not directly name or link to it.
The statement contained the following paragraph:

> We continually revisit our procedures for progress towards equity and inclusion and assess their efficacy.
> We do not think that automated procedures of assessment are appropriate for this purpose.
> Algorithms performing such categorization suffer from inherent limitations that distort the notion of balance we are striving for.
> Specifically, categorization of disjoint regional, ethnic or gender groups of scientists, while easing classification, also functions divisively.

Our ISMB submission was reviewed by 5 peer reviewers and [rejected](https://github.com/greenelab/iscb-diversity-manuscript/issues/37) on 2020-03-13.
We thank the reviewers for their input, and have made our [responses public](https://github.com/greenelab/iscb-diversity-manuscript/blob/master/content/response-to-reviewers.md)).

Much of the feedback centered around the inherent imperfections of automated detection of race or nationality.
Therefore, we expanded our assessment to include country of affiliation, which can be detected with high fidelity from PubMed metadata.
Adding affiliation information allowed us to examine disparities within a single country and to rule out geographic disparities as the sole factor leading to an underrepresentation of Asian honorees.

We appreciate the feedback we have received.
Early indications suggest ISCB may be heeding the findings of our analysis and increasing the diversity of honorees.
In 2020, among 12 ISCB Fellows and 5 ISMB keynote speakers, the mean predicted probability of each honoree having an East Asian name is 33%, higher than any estimate in previous years (see [notebook](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity/15.analyze-2020.html)).
The set of honorees also includes the first ISCB Fellow from China.
Compared to past years, the 2020 honorees appear to better reflect the diversity of scientists in the computational biology field.
