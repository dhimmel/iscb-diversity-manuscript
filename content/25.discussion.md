## Discussion

A major challenge that we faced in carrying out this work was to narrow down geographic origins for some groups of names.
Some name origin groups, such as Hispanic names, are geographically disparate.
We were unable to construct a classifier that could distinguish between names from Iberian countries (Spain and Portugal) from those in Latin America in the group of Hispanic names.
Discrepancies in representation between these groups are thus undetectable by our classifier.
Honoree counts of those with Hispanic names are influenced from Spain as well as Latin America.
In such cases, our analyses may substantially understate the extent to which minoritized scientists are underrepresented among honorees and authors.

Biases in authorship practices may also result in our underestimation of the composition of minoritized scientists within the field.
We estimated the composition of the field using corresponding author status, but in neuroscience [@doi:10.1101/275362] and other disciplines [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2004956] women are underrepresented among such authors.
Such an effect would cause us to underestimate the number of women in the field.
Though this effect has been studied with respect to gender, we are not aware of similar work examining race, ethnicity, or name origins.

We acknowledged that our supervised learning approaches are neither error free nor bias free.
By integrating different methods and preserving uncertainty by analyzing prediction probabilities rather than applying a hard assignment for each prediction, we hope to alleviate these biases and discover insightful findings that correctly reflect the current representation diversity at conferences.
We also weighted work using citation count to control for the differential impact of research contributions.
However, we note a potential bias for using citation counts: female scientists of different disciplines are cited less often than their male counterparts [@arxiv:2001.01002; @doi:10.1002/ece3.4993; @doi:10.1038/s41550-017-0141].
To the extent that there may be a bias in citation practices, we should expect that the bias for honorees would align with one for citations, meaning that our analysis would understate the severity of disparities.
In a [previous version](https://greenelab.github.io/iscb-diversity-manuscript/v/788a0802c75a57e967c706c373bfb85432c0f0b3/) of the study, we performed the same analyses without citation counts and found even more pronounced differences between the two groups of authors and honorees.
Taken together, because of the bias in citation practices, potentially overestimated number of US-affiliated authors, ambiguity in geographic origins of Hispanic names, our estimation of the underrepresentation of East Asian honorees and overrepresentation of US-affiliated honorees would render a conservative one.

Focusing on an international society and meetings, we measured honor and authorship rates worldwide.
In this setting, we observe disparities by name groups.
Because invitation and honor patterns could be driven by biases associated with name groups, geography, or other factors, we cross-referenced name group predictions with author affiliations to disentangle the relationship between geographic regions, name groups and invitation probabilities.
We found that disparities persisted even within the group of honorees with a US affiliation.

An important questions to ask when measuring representation is what the right level of representation is.
We suggest that considering equity may be more appropriate than strictly diversity.
For example, we found similar representation of women between authors and honorees, which suggests honoree diversity is similar to that of authors.
However, if fewer women are in the field because of systemic factors that inhibit their participation, we would not have reached equity.
In addition to holding fewer corresponding authorship positions, on average, female scientists of different disciplines are cited less often [@arxiv:2001.01002, @doi:10.1002/ece3.4993, @doi:10.1038/s41550-017-0141], invited by journals to submit papers less often [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2004956], suggested as reviewers less often [@doi:10.1038/541455a], and receive significantly worse review scores [@doi:10.1002/ece3.4993].
Meanwhile, a review of women's underrepresentation in math-intensive fields argued that today's underrepresentation is not explained by historic forms of discrimination but factors surrounding fertility decisions and lifestyle choices, whether freely made or constrained by biology and society [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1014871108].
A recent analysis of gender inequality across different disciplines showed that, although both gender groups have equivalent annual productivity, women scientists have higher dropout rates throughout their scientific careers [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1914221117].

We found that ISCB's honorees and keynote speakers, though not yet reaching gender parity, appear to have similar gender proportion to the field as a whole.
On the other hand, honorees include significantly fewer people of color than the field as a whole, and Asian scientists are dramatically underrepresented among honorees.
Societies' honoree selection process failing to reflect the diversity of the field can play a part in why minoritized scientists' innovations are discounted [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1915378117].
Although we estimate the fraction of non-White and non-Asian authors to be relatively similar to the estimated honoree rate, we note that both are represented at levels substantially lower than in the US population.

Societies, both through their honorees and the individuals who deliver keynotes at their meetings, can play a positive role in improving the presence of female STEM role models, which can boost young students' interests in STEM [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1014871108] and, for example, lead to higher persistence for undergraduate women in geoscience [@doi:10.1130/GES01659.1].
Efforts are underway to create Wikipedia entries for more female [@doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05947-8] and black, Asian, and minority scientists [@doi:10.1038/d41586-019-00812-8], which can help early-career scientists identify role models.
Societies can contribute toward equity if they design policies to honor scientists in ways that counter these biases such as ensuring diversity in the selection committees.

The central role that scientists play in evaluating each other and each other's findings makes equity critical.
Even many nominally objective methods of assessing excellence (e.g., h-index, grant funding obtained, number of high-impact peer-reviewed publications, and total number of peer-reviewed publications) are subject to the bias of peers during review.
These could be affected by explicit biases, implicit biases, or pernicious biases in which a reviewer might consider a path of inquiry, as opposed to an individual, to be more or less meritorious based on the reviewer's own background [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aaw7238, @doi:10.1101/400515].
Our efforts to measure the diversity of honorees in an international society suggests that, while a focus on gender parity may be improving some aspects of diversity among honorees, contributions from scientists of color are underrecognized.
