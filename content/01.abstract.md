## Abstract

Delivering a keynote talk at a conference organized by a scientific society, or being named as a fellow by such a society, indicates that a scientist is held in high regard by their colleagues.
To explore if the distribution of such indicators of esteem in the field of bioinformatics reflects the composition of this field,
we compared the gender, country of affiliation, race/ethnicity and name-origin of 412 researchers who had been recognized by the _International Society for Computational Biology_ (75 fellows and 337 keynote speakers) with 34,050 researchers who had been the corresponding authors on papers in three leading bioinformatics journals between 1993 and 2019.
The proportion of female fellows and keynote speakers was similar to that of the field overall.
However, fellows and keynote speakers with an affiliation in the United States were over-represented by a factor of 1.6;
moreover, almost half of this excess was accounted for by a deficit of 41 fellows and keynote authors from China, France and Italy.
Furthermore, within the US we found an excess of white fellows and keynote speakers, and a depletion of Asian fellows and keynote speakers.
Globally, names of East Asian origin have been persistently underrepresented among fellows and keynote speakers.
